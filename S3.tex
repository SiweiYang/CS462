All answers should be accompanied by proofs.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item{} [10 marks]  
Must every primitive word of length $> 1$ have at least two 
unbordered conjugates?  Prove or disprove.


\medskip

\item{} [10 marks]  
Consider the equation in words $x \sha y = z^2$, where $\sha$ is the
perfect shuffle.  Describe
all solutions to this equation.  Hint:  there are separate cases
depending on whether $|x|, |y|$ are both even or both odd.

\medskip

(By ``describe all solutions'' we mean come up with a characterization
of the solutions that is somewhat analogous to the descriptions in
Theorems 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 of the course text, giving necessary and
sufficient conditions for $x, y, z$.)


\medskip

\item{} [10 marks]  
Call a word $w$ {\it uneven} if every nonempty subword
has the property that at least one letter appears an odd number of
times.  For example, ${\tt abac}$ is uneven.   

\begin{itemize} 

\item[(a)]  [5 marks] Show that if $w$ is an uneven word over an
alphabet with $k$ letters, then $|w| < 2^k$.

\item[(b)] [5 marks]  Prove that the bound in (a) is sharp, by
exhibiting an uneven word of length $2^k -1 $ over every alphabet of
size $k \geq 1$.

\end{itemize}





\end{enumerate}
