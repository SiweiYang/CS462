All answers should be accompanied by proofs.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item{} [10 marks]  
Call a language $L$ {\sl commutative} if for all $x, y \in L$
we have $xy = yx$.  Show that $L$ is commutative if and only if there exists
a word $w$ such that $L \subseteq w^*$.

\medskip

\item{} [10 marks]  
Suppose $A = \lbrace x \rbrace$ is a language consisting
of one nonempty word and $B = \lbrace y, z \rbrace$ is a language 
consisting of two (distinct) words, such that $AB = BA$.  Show that
$x, y, z$ are all powers of the same word.

\medskip

\item{} [10 marks]  
We say that $x$ is an {\it abelian square} if it can be written
in the form $y y'$, where $|y| = |y'|$ and $y'$ is a permutation
of $y$.  An example in English is {\tt reappear}, since
{\tt pear} is a permutation of {\tt reap}.

Let $x$ be a word over the alphabet $\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$.
Show that $x$ is an abelian square
if and only if there exists a word $y$ such that
$x \in \shuff(y, y^R)$.  Here $\shuff$ means (not necessarily
perfect) shuffle, described on page 57 of the text.
