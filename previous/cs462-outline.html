<h2>Course Description:</h2>
Building on CS 360, this course discusses more advanced topics in formal languages and automata theory, with applications to compiler writing. In particular, several practical parsing methods are discussed.
<P>
<h2>Course Objectives:</h2>
To introduce advanced topics in formal languages and parsing techniques to students, and enhance students' understanding of formal languages, automata theory and complexity theory.  To look at interesting and challenging problems.

<P>
<h2>Course Overview:</h2>
Properties of Strings (3 hours)

Outline of formal language theory. Strings, machines, proofs by induction. Combinatorics on words. Thue's problem.

Regular Sets (9 hours)

Review. Closure of regular sets under quotient, substitution, and inverse homomorphism. Decision algorithms for regular sets. The Myhill-Nerode theorem. Minimization of finite automata. Finite-state transducers.

Context-free Languages (6 hours)

Review. Coping with ambiguity. Inherently ambiguous CFL's. Closure of context-free languages under substitution, inverse homomorphism, and intersection with regular sets. Decision algorithms for context-free languages. Parsing arbitrary context-free grammars. Decidability results for CFG's.

Parsing (9 hours)

Phases of compilation. Top-down parsing. LL(1) grammars. Bottom-up parsing. LR(0) grammars. LR(k) grammars.

The Chomsky Hierarchy (3 hours)

Left- and right-regular grammars. Unrestricted (Type 0) grammars. Equivalence of Type 0 grammars and Turing machines. Context-sensitive languages. Linear bounded automata.

Deterministic Context-free Languages (3 hours)

Normal forms. Closure under complementation. Relationship to LR(0) grammars.

Other Language Classes (3 hours)

L-systems. Applications to computer graphics. Rational series.

<h2>Evaluation:</h2>
<b>CS462</b>: 11 written assignments (60%); a take-home final exam (40%).

<P>
<h2>Late policy:</h2>
<P>
Each assignment is due in class on Wednesdays.  No late assignments will be accepted, and no assignments that are handed in after the solutions are given out will be accepted. If there are any valid reasons such as serious illness, please see the instructor.   The lowest mark of the 11 assignments will be discarded.</p>


<P>
<h2>Rules for Group Work:</h2>
Discussions on general aspects of the assignments are allowed, but each student should hand in his/her own solutions. ANY USE OF OUTSIDE SOURCES must be documented. 

Discussions during the take-home final period, other than asking the instructor or TA for clarifications on the take-home final, are strictly forbidden.

<P>
<h2>Indication of how late submission of assignments and missed assignments will be treated</h2>
<P>
Each assignment is due in class on Wednesdays.  No late assignments will be accepted, and no assignments that are handed in after the solutions are given out will be accepted. If there are any valid reasons such as serious illness, please see the instructor.   The lowest mark of the 11 assignments will be discarded.</p>


<P>
<h2> Indication of where students are to submit assignments and pick up marked assignments</h2>
Each of the 11 assignments will be due on Wednesdays in class. The solutions will be available on the course web page. Marked assignments will be handed back in class, and students can also pick up see the instructor to pick up marked assignments.

<B>Academic Integrity:</B> In order to maintain a culture of 
academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are 
expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.
[Check <A 
HREF="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/</A> 
for more information.]
<P>
<B>Grievance:</B> A student who believes that a decision affecting 
some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may 
have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70, Student Petitions 
and Grievances, Section 4, <A 
HREF="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm">www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm</A>. 
When in doubt please be certain to contact the department's administrative 
assistant who will provide further assistance.
<P>
<B>Discipline:</B> A student is expected to know what constitutes academic 
integrity [check <A 
HREF="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/">www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/</A>] 
to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for 
his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an 
offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., 
plagiarism, cheating) or about 'rules' for group work/collaboration should 
seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the 
undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences 
and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student 
Discipline, <A 
HREF="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm">www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm</A>. 
For typical penalties check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties, <A 
HREF="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm">www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm</A>.
<P>
<B>Appeals:</B> A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 
(Student Petitions and Grievances) (other than a petition) or Policy 71 
(Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who 
believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 
(Student Appeals) <A 
HREF="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm">www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm</A>.
<P>
<B>Note for Students with Disabilities:</B> The Office for persons with 
Disabilities (OPD), located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with 
all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for 
students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of 
the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the 
impact of your disability, please register with the OPD at the beginning 
of each academic term.
