<p>
The work you hand in must be your own.
Plagarism is the act of presenting someone else's words or ideas as your own.
In particular, here are some common forms of plagarism:
<UL>
<LI> looking at someone else's completed assignment before completing yours
<LI> asking for solutions/hints to assignment questions on the internet
</UL>

Here are some things that are allowed:
<UL>
<LI> you discuss an assignment question with someone; you leave the discussion
with no written notes and write up your own solution and acknowledge your 
discussion partner
<LI> you think about a problem and get stuck and search in the library or 
the internet for similar topics; you write up your own solution without any reference
materials or notes in front of you and you acknowledge the sources you looked at
</UL>

<h3> <A NAME=resources>Resources</h3>
The text for the course is <b>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</b>, 2nd edition, 
by Sipser.   A copy will be on reserve in the library.
<HR>
<p>

<h3> <A NAME=assignments>Assignments</h3>

Assignments will be marked based on correctness but also on quality of
explanations: strive for clarity and precision.

Assignments are due Thursdays in class or by midnight
in the assignment box labelled "CS365" on
the 3rd floor of MC in the corner with the bridge to DC.
You may hand in ONE assignment late, which means handing it in by noon on the following Monday.
No other late assignments will be accepted (except for
serious illness, etc.)  Assignments will be returned in class.

You will get the password for the solutions in class (or send email if you forget).
