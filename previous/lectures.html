<H2> Lecture Summaries -- Winter 2011</H2>
<P>

<H3> Week 1</H3>

Lecture 1:  Wednesday, January 5, 2011: <BR>
I handed out the <A HREF="info.pdf">Course information sheet</A>.
<a href="prob1.pdf">Problem Set 1</a> is available and due January 12.
Slide: <A HREF="fl.ps">formal languages and connections to other areas</A>.
We went over the basic definitions of concepts such as word (string),
language, reversal, power, palindrome, empty string, prefix, suffix, subword,
etc.  (pages 1-4 of the course textbook).  We also went over the definitions
in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.  We proved the first theorem of
Lyndon-Sch&uuml;tzenberger (Theorem 2.3.2).

We continued our discussion of inverse morphism.  We showed how to
represent shuffle using morphisms and inverse morphisms (Example 3.3.8),
and proved Theorem 3.3.9.  We covered the material in section 3.4.

and began section 3.5.

<H3>Week 7</H3>

Lecture 12:  Monday, February 14, 2011:<BR>

string distinguishing two automata.  Brzozowski's algorithm (introduction).
<P>

Lecture 13:  Wednesday, February 16, 2011:<BR>

We proved that Brzozowski's algorithm works.  Example of Brzozowski's
algorithm.  The operations sup() and sub().  Minimal elements.  Proof that
sub(L) and sup(L) are always regular.
<P>

You may want to read <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Papers/minimal5.ps">this paper</a> which gives the proof that minimal elements
of the prime numbers (expressed in base 10) are as described on the cards
I handed out.  It also gives an idea of how to approach the problem on the
problem set (but the one on the problem set is much easier).

Open problem:  given CFL's 
<i>L</i><sub>1</sub> and
<i>L</i><sub>2</sub> with 
<i>L</i><sub>1</sub> &sube;
<i>L</i><sub>2</sub> and
<i>L</i><sub>2</sub> - <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> infinite, is there always a CFL
<i>L</i> such that 
<i>L</i><sub>1</sub> &sube;
<i>L</i> &sube;
<i>L</i><sub>2</sub>  such that
<i>L</i><sub>2</sub> - <i>L</i> and
<i>L</i> - <i>L</i><sub>1</sub>

This is not known, even in the case where <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> = &Sigma;<sup>*</sup>.
