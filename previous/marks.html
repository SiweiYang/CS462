<OL>
<LI> Write legibly, in pen, not pencil.  If possible, type your
solutions, or use a word processor.

<LI> Write the answer to each question on a separate sheet of
paper.  If you have left some problems unsolved, say so.  Staple your
pages together in order; do not use paper clips.

<LI> Write your name and student number on the first sheet.

<LI> Make your answers clear and concise, but don't omit
details.  Be sure your arguments will convince a skeptical (but
intelligent) TA.

<LI> If a final result is requested, show all your work
to get that solution, and put a box around the final answer.

<LI> Don't try to fool the TA's!  The following phrases
are tip-offs:

	<UL>
	<LI> "Obviously ..."

	<LI> "It can be easily shown that ..."

	<LI> "It is clear that ..."
	</UL>

<LI> When doing a proof by induction, state <i>precisely</i>
what your induction hypothesis is and what variable you are inducting
on.
