Leonid Levin</H1> 

<A HREF="http://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/lnd/">
Leonid A. Levin</A> was born on November 2, 1948 in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine.  
He wrote his doctoral thesis in 1971 under Kolmogorov,
but was denied his Ph. D. for political reasons.  
In 1973, he published a paper in which he independently
discovered results of <A HREF="cook.html">Stephen Cook</A> and
<A HREF="karp.html">Richard Karp</A> on NP-completeness.

Levin emigrated to the US in 1978 and now teaches at Boston University.
He is well-known for his habit of publishing extremely short papers, some
only one page long.
