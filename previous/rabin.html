Michael Oser Rabin was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland) in 1931.
He emigrated to Palestine in 1935 and attended Hebrew University in
Jerusalem.  He received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University.
He later taught at Princeton University.  In 1958 he moved to the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem.
His early influences included <A HREF="kleene.html">Stephen
Kleene</A>'s book <i>Introduction to Metamathematics</i> and the work
of <A HREF="turing.html">Alan Turing</A>.

Among his other accomplishments, Rabin is known for his fundamental 1959
paper with Dana Scott, which constructed a firm mathematical basis
for the theory of finite automata, and introduced the concept of
nondeterminism.  For this paper, along with other achievements, Rabin
was a co-winner of the 1976
<A HREF="http://info.acm.org/awards/taward.html">
ACM Turing award</A>, computer science's highest award.

Currently, Rabin divides his time between positions at Harvard University and
Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
