<H1> Cheating and the Student Academic Discipline Policy </H1>

<i>November 24, 1994</i>
<P>

Cheating on exams, tests, or assignments is a serious offense because it
jeopardizes the integrity and reputation of our academic programs.
<P>

Cheating on exams includes using unauthorized aids or communicating in any
way with others during an examination.  The penalty for cheating on a test
or exam will range from suspension from the university for at least one term
to expulsion.
<P>

Cheating on assignments and projects includes copying another student's
solution and submitting it as your own, allowing another student to copy
your solution, or collaborating excessively with another student.  The
standard penalty for cheating on an assignment or project is as follows: a
grade of -100% will be assigned for the piece of work, with a minimum
deduction of 5% from the final course grade.
<P>

With assignments it is possible, and indeed desirable, to discuss methods of
solution of problems with classmates, TAs, and instructors.  However, the
solution that you submit must be worked through by yourself and written in
your own words.  The only exceptions are assignments or projects which the
instructor designates as group activities.
<P>

All academic offenses are reported to the Associate Dean for Undergraduate
Studies.  A second academic offense will lead to the student being suspended
from the university for at least one term and may lead to expulsion.
