<H2> CS 462/662 - Take-Home Final Examination Groundrules 2011 </H2>

1.  You must pick up this exam from Helen Jardine, in the main CS office
(DC 2326), sometime on TBA <b>unless you have already
made other arrangements with the instructor</b>.  The main CS office is
open from 8:30 AM to 11:55 AM, and from 1:05 PM to 4:25 PM.
<P>

If you cannot pick up the exam on this date, you must make other
arrangements <b>IN ADVANCE</b>.
<P>

2.  The time that you pick up the exam will be recorded.  You must
return the exam by <b>THIS TIME</b> exactly one week (168 hours) later.  Two
percent (2%) will be deducted from your mark for each hour (or fraction
thereof) that the exam is late.  Return the exam to the CS office (DC
2326).
<P>


3.  You may use any books, journal articles, or notes for this exam;
all use of external sources <b>MUST</b> be cited.  (Of course, it goes without
saying that you will benefit most, educationally speaking, by not
trying to find solutions in books or articles.) However...
<P>


4.  You may <b>NOT</b> collaborate in any way with any other person about the
material of the exam.  This includes discussion with other professors,
students, etc.
<P>

It includes conversations, written communications, electronic mail,
posting to bulletin boards, chat rooms, newsgroups, etc.  
Any violations will be grounds for
receiving <b>NO</b> marks for the exam.  I will clarify the meaning of
questions but will not give any hints.
<P>


5.  Corrections and/or clarifications will be posted in the newsgroup
for the course.  You are responsible for reading this newsgroup on a
daily basis during the exam period.
<P>


6.  The exam is worth 40% of your mark.  (For grad students, 35%).
<P>


7.  Some problems will be easier than typical homework problems, some
will be harder.  This is supposed to be a learning experience, and you
are not necessarily expected to solve every problem.
<P>
