<H2> Description</H2>
<P>
     Models of computation such as the Turing machine and the
random access machine (RAM) are so powerful that it is quite difficult
to prove explicit theorems about what they can and cannot compute.
<P>

     In the late fifties and early sixties,
mathematicians and computer scientists
began to study simpler models of computation such as the
<i>finite automaton</i> and the <i>pushdown automaton</i>.  These
models of computation were later found to have many practical
applications:  regular expressions (used in editing and filename
specification); parsing and compiling computer languages; specification
(LEX and YACC), etc.
<P>

     Building on CS 360/365, this course discusses more advanced topics in
formal languages and automata theory.
Topics that we will discuss include:  Thue's
problem, the Lyndon theorems,
combinatorics on words, closure properties of
regular sets, the Myhill-Nerode theorem, ambiguity of CFG's,
inherent ambiguity, the Chomsky hierarchy, DCFL's, and
other language classes.
<P>

	 We will also cover some "real-life" applications including:
phases of compilation, top-down parsing, LL(1) grammars, bottom-up
parsing, LR(0) grammars, and LR(<i>k</i>) grammars.
<P>

     There will be 11 problem sets, with problems of
varying difficulty.  These will be worth 60% of the mark.  You should
expect to spend 4-5 hours a week on these problems.  
<P>

     The assignments will be handed out and due as follows:

</PRE>

     Hand your assignments in during class.
Late policy:  
solutions to problem sets will be handed out in the class on the due date;
any assignments received after that time will
receive no credit.    Your single lowest mark on an assignment will be
discarded.
<P>

   If you have questions about how your assignment was marked, please
contact the TA first.  If you are still not satisfied, then
you can contact the instructor.
<P>

     There will be no midterm.
<P>

     There will be a <A HREF="final.html">take-home final</A>
 which is worth 40% of the mark.  It
will consist of some easy problems and some challenging ones.   
Collaboration of any kind is not allowed on the final.
<P>

     Graduate students will be expected to complete a term project in 
addition to the other work.  For graduate students, the mark breakdown
will be:  problem sets, 50%; final project, 15%; and final exam,
35%.  The project involves reading papers from the literature about
a topic in formal languages or parsing of your choice, and then writing
a short (5-15 pages) report on what you have learned.
<P>

You are permitted to discuss <i>general aspects</i> of the problem sets
with other students in the class, but each person should hand in
his/her own copy of the solutions.  
Plagiarism - using outside sources without
documentation - will be dealt with severely.  
Posting problems on Internet bulletin boards, chat groups, newsgroups, etc.
and requesting hints or solutions is not permitted.
<P>

<i>Any</i> use of outside sources
(people, books, articles, etc.) <i>must</i>
be documented in anything you hand in for this course.  You are
welcome to use outside sources, but remember
that the goal is to <i>learn</i>:  you should try to solve the
problems on your own first.   When in doubt about whether you need
to cite something, err on the side of caution.
<P>

The Mathematics Faculty standard penalty for cheating on assignments
is a grade of -100% for the assignment, with a minimum deduction of
5% from the final course mark.  See the document
<A HREF="cheating.html">Cheating and the Student Academic Discipline
Policy</A> for more details.
<P>
<HR>      
<H2> Keeping in Touch. </H2>
<P>

There is a newsgroup for the course -- <tt> uw.cs.cs462</tt>.
I will use the newsgroup to issue corrections and clarifications
to homework assignments and the take-home final.  
<P>

The course web page has copies of problem sets, hints for getting better
marks, errata for the course textbook, cheating policy, and summaries for
every lecture.
